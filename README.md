# Welcome!
FabrikaBr is an embryonic platform formed by professionals and students of Computer Engineering. Our goal is to develop technological products and services that can improve people's lives..

We are enthusiastic about new technologies and their applications, mainly IA, IOT and Blockchain. We believe in community economic models and decentralized governance. Our applications under development are based on process improvement, enabling greater savings in resources and consequently labor efficiency. Our work methodology follows a model that values human interaction following the best practices.

We provide tools to ensure the reliability of operations and information by solving supply chain problems.

Our main scope is to develop, integrate, implement and collaborate with other decentralized projects.

Fundamental analysis on cryptography projects, smart contract verification, fraud, tokenomics and economics (we do not provide any kind of financial advice or asset buy/sell indications). We do not identify our customers, we preserve the anonymity of the contractors, we do not disclose results data only the PKI holder can access the report through an intelligent contract.

The DeWork protocol (decentralized work), allows FabrikaBr to be project-oriented, remote teams with people from all over the world..
